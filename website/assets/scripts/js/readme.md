# Need to move final javascript uglified compressed file(s) 
# from `/jekyll-stack/assets/scripts/js/` folder to this place 
# to have it after in the `/_builld-website-static/assets/scripts/js` folder
# because by default Jekyll moves files from this folder to `/_builld-website-static/jekyll-stack/assets/scripts/js/` folder
